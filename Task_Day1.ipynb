    "### Aims of the workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this session is to introduce you to the Python Interpreter and Jupyter Notebook environment. This workshop will serve as an introductionto Python, putting into practice all that we’ve covered this week. It is important to take time to understand these basic concepts, and explore what they can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please see ‘Useful Information’ below on how to lookup certain Python functionality. The concept behind this workshop is about discovery, and experimentation surrounding topics covered so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to discuss the work with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this workshop you may find the following useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3.8/\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to lookup core language features of Python 3.8 as well as tangential information about the Python Language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter itself offers some basic documentation for people new to the editor. These can be found on \n",
    "\n",
    "https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter can also use markdown cells for text input to describethings. If you wish to annotate each cell as to which Exercise it belongs to, you may find this useful:\n",

    "\n",
    "I encourage you to discuss the contents of the workshop with me , and any findings you gather from the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workshops are not isolated, if you have questions from previous lecture content, please come and talk to me via messaging me from your udemy account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of this workshop are ​not​ intended to be 100% complete within the session; as such it’s expected that some of this work be completed outside of the session. \n",

    "## Running A Jupyter/IPython Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions showing Jupyter Notebook installation, is available on previous lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a server which runs on the local machine. It will use whichever directory it is invoked within as the root folder. It is then able to see all sub-folders within that , if you are wishing to install this at home, you may need to follow pip instructions for installing jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook can be launched from the command line by invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a server, typically on ​http://localhost:8888/tree​, and should automatically open a new tab in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook server uses a token, generated at launch, to authenticate access. By default, the notebook server is accessible to anybody with network access to your machine over the port, with the correct token.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are asked for a password or token, you can always invoke:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook list\n",
    "    \n",
    " This will provide you a list of currently active Notebook servers (you can run multiple, on different ports, for different folders), along with their token, all within a single URL.\n",
    " \n",
    "### PIP and packages\n",
    " \n",
    " PIP is python’s packaging tool, it enables the installation of libraries. If you tried to import pandas when starting your notebook, you may have noticed that it gives you an error. This is because, by default, pandas is not installed within the super lab.\n",
    " \n",
    " Python has a rich community backing, with several libraries available over at PyPI which users can install. Users can even make their own libraries and host them online for others to use.\n",
    " \n",
    " Most packages can be installed by using\n",
    " \n",
    "     pip install packageName\n",
    " \n",
    " Remember, you can always use `pip help install` for specific help information on installing."
